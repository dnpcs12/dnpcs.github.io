Abstract
</h1>
<br>
We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations. Existing cooperative agent systems often struggle with efficiently processing continuously accumulating information, managing globally suboptimal planning due to lack of consideration of collaborators, and addressing false planning caused by environmental changes introduced by other collaborators. To overcome these challenges, we propose the RElevance, Proximity, and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-4o-mini. REVECA enables efficient memory management, optimal planning, and cost-effective prevention of false planning by leveraging Relevance Estimation, Adaptive Planning, and Trajectory-based Validation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate REVECA's superiority over existing methods across various benchmarks, while a user study reveals its potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation.
